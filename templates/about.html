                <p class="mission-text">
                    Daiva Anughara is dedicated to preserving, sharing, and facilitating the practice of ancient spiritual wisdom, 
                    particularly the sacred tradition of Bhairava Sadhana and Sādhanā Paddhati.
                </p>
                <p class="mission-text">
                    Our mission is to make authentic spiritual knowledge accessible to sincere seekers while maintaining 
                    the sacredness and reverence that these practices deserve. We believe that spiritual wisdom should be 
                    shared freely, as a transmission of grace rather than a commercial transaction.

                    I am Manjunath Mahendrakar, a seeker and sadhaka walking the timeless path of Maa Kamakya Bhairava tattva, 
                    guided by the blessings of my Diksha Guru, Avaduthas, and the grace of Siddhars. What I share here are not 
                    teachings, but sacred glimpses—tiny ripples from the vast ocean of His consciousness.

                <p class="personal-intro-text">
                    This offering is a living prayer to Guru Bhairava—a space born from love and reverence for the fierce 
                    compassion of our Iṣṭa, the hidden treasures of the Puranas, and the journey of inner stillness.
